# Geoloc
My test project that converts coordinates to address and address to coordinates.
***
After launching, you can open a window in which there will be 2 fields.
Enter the coordinates in one and after clicking on the search, get the address.
In the second line, enter the address and get geolocation in the format Longitude, latitude.
***
The program works via the Yandex Geo Api.
